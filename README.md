Project for Olin's Software Design Class

Launch either the rawmingui.py or final_product.py to begin using the module. To install any missing modules, use the installer file provided in the top layer of the directory.

The application will ask you to sign in or sign up first - if you have not already used this application, please click sign up to enter yourself into the system. From this point the application will launch and you can start sharing links with other users! You will need to know another users username in order to send links to others.

Have fun, and happy sharing!
